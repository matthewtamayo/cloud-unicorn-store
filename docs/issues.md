#### Issues Faced

- for some reason the modal component of allium doesn't pop up even though it has been passed the correct state
  <br>
- when going to a page's url the coomponent does not get passed the props assigned to it... to circumvent this I had to place the states and constants depended upon inside the page's component in the meantime. Hopefully redux can fix this issue or providers.
  <br>
- Regarding the floating cart icon. I used a button there but I may have to change it into a div... The button components of allium doesn't expect there to be a component to be its children...
